# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF MOVIE REVIEWS

> In this project we have performed sentiment analysis on movie review dataset 
using VALANCE AWARE DICTIONARY FOR SENTIMENT REASONING (VADER).


## General Information

VADER stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. It is a lexicon and 
rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing the sentiment 
or emotion expressed in text.

VADER is built upon a pre-constructed lexicon that contains words and their associated 
sentiment scores. The lexicon is enhanced with rules that handle various linguistic and 
grammatical properties of text, such as negations, capitalization, punctuation, and 
context-dependent sentiment.

When VADER is applied to a piece of text, it breaks down the text into individual words 
and evaluates their sentiment using the lexicon and rules. Each word is assigned a 
sentiment score, indicating how positive, negative, or neutral it is. The scores are then 
combined to generate an overall sentiment score for the entire text.

Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, VADER is widely used in various applications, 
including social media analysis, customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and 
opinion mining. It offers a quick and efficient way to analyze sentiment in text without 
requiring extensive training data or complex machine learning models.
